# log-analyzer-fabric
This is a simple Flask app built to serve as a testing platform for FABRIC's Q&A and Code Generation tools before launching them. It will allow members of the UK FABRIC team and the RENCI team to view the queries they have run for testing and rate them based on the response and the urls generated by each model. Additionally, members can filter queries based on time, tool type, model, and ratings. Finally, there is an interactive Plotly graph that demonstrates the performance of each model by calculating and visualizing the ratings given to each of them.
