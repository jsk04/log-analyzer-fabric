# log-analyzer-fabric
## Overview
This is a simple Flask app built to serve as a testing platform for FABRIC's Q&A and Code Generation tools before launching them. It will allow members of the UK FABRIC team and the RENCI team to view the queries they have run for testing and rate them based on the response and the urls generated by each model. Additionally, members can filter queries based on time, tool type, model, and ratings. Finally, there is an interactive Plotly graph that demonstrates the performance of each model by calculating and visualizing the ratings given to each of them. 

## Sample .env 
In order to run this app, a .env file needs to be setup in the same directory as the other files of this app. It is used to store the locations of necessary files and secret keys. 

Here is a sample that can be replicated: 
```
# .env (sample configuration for Log Analyzer)
# Fill in your own credentials, secrets, and paths

# Flask App Secret
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=replace_this_with_a_secret_key

# AI tool log location
LOG_DIR='/path/to/gradio/logs'

# Database configuration (this should be created automatically when running  app.py)
DATABASE_PATH="/path/to/database/file"

# User allowlist/role files
AUTHORIZED_USERS_FILE='/path/to/file'
# (Optional) Other settings:
READONLY_USERS_FILE='/path/to/file'

# Miscellaneous
FILES_OFFSETS_PATH='/path/to/file'
```
